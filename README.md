using camelCase for naming react jsx classes and functions;
using camelCase for naming react folders and files;
using dashes in between css class and id names;

react folder structure should be as followed:
    -componentName
        -componentName.js
        -componentName.css

add new react components in "src/components/" folder

If a component is a bit complicated try to devide it into smaller components to make up one big component and export it. 
Each "small" component should have a logical name and a css file with the same name to avoid any confusion.
